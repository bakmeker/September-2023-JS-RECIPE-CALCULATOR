# September-2023-JS-RECIPE-CALCULATOR

Tired of deciding what to cook with the ingredients you have in your fridge? Look no further!
Introducing my web app, where i've compiled my favorite recipes directly into JavaScript.

I'm and my wife had some problems to deicde what meal we are going to make, so i decided to solve this problem for us :)

Here's how it works:

1. Fridge-Friendly Cooking: Simply input the ingredients you have in your fridge, and it will provide you with a shortlist of delicious dishes you can make right away. (recipes supposed to be written in JS)

2. Random Recipe: If you're planning a trip to the store or just feeling adventurous, click on "Random Recipe," and we'll suggest a delightful dish you can prepare today.

My web app has made meal planning a breeze for us. It's a project I'm truly proud of, as i have built it from the ground up. While i did seek guidance from the internet for JS methods as .trim, .includes, .toLowerCase , i was avoiding any direct copying from similar projects.
